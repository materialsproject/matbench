    "algorithm_long": "Use Ax Bayesian adaptive design to simultaneously optimize 23 hyperparameters of CrabNet. 100 sequential design iterations were used, and parameters were chosen based on a combination of intuition and algorithm/data constraints (e.g. elemental featurizers which were missing elements contained in the dataset were removed). The first 46 iterations (23*2 parameters) were based on SOBOL sampling to create a rough initial model, while the remaining 56 iterations were Bayesian adaptive design iterations. For the inner loops (where hyperparameter optimization is performed), the average MAE across each of the five inner folds was used as Ax's objective to minimize. The best parameter set was then trained on all the inner fold data and used to predict on the test set (unknown during hyperparameter optimization). This is nested cross-validation, and is computationally expensive.",
