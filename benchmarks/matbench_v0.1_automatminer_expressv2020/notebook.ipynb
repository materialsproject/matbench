    "# Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This submission is for Automatminer Express v1.0.3.20200727. Automatminer is a fully-automated, feature-based algorithm for prototyping ML pipelines with AutoML search for hyperparameter optimization. Find the full source code of automatminer at [https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer).\n",

    "# Algorithm description\n",
    "The Automatminer express model is an abridged version of the full Automatminer pipeline described in [Dunn et al.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatminer works in 4 distinct steps:\n",
    "- **Autofeaturization**: Sequentially apply many featurizers implemented in matminer (most of which are \"hand crafted\" (meaning a scientist has thought about their physical interpretation and relevance); automatically remove those failing preliminary validity prechecks and those with high failure rates.\n",
    "- **Data cleaning**: Remove and impute nan samples. Remove erroneous and inf features from autofeaturization.\n",
    "- **Feature reduction**: Intelligently reduce the number of features - for example, removing similar features between distinct featurizers with correlation-based feature reduction, then sequentially applying tree-model-based feature reduction.\n",
    "- **AutoML**: Using TPOT's genetic algorithm-based optimization, evolve different machine learning pipelines based on internal validation scores. This optimization also automatically tunes the hyperparamters of the models. Some of the included models are Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression, Linear regression (with various regularizations), and Support Vector Machines; a full specificiation of all the models and hyperparameter grids defined for the preset is available in the automatminer [source code](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer).\n",
    "\n",
    "![pipe](pipe.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data store of automatminer is the pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "![df](dataframe_pipe.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary working object in automatminer is the MatPipe, which holds comprehensive information about each of the above steps. MatPipes utilize a fit/predict style syntax similar to sklearn's `BaseEstimator`. After being fit, MatPipes can be inspected (detailed internal information for each pipeline) with the `.inspect` method or summarized (more abbreviated internal information) with the `.summarize()` method.\n",

    "This notebook is best run on manycore machines with a high number of `n_jobs` for parallelization. Intermediate results should be saved such that intermittent failures do not crash the entire benchmark. Walltime requested should approximately be 26hr per task, as the maximum evaluation time for each task is 24 hours of AutoML optimization.\n",
