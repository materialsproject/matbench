  "algorithm_long": "This algorithm is a modification of the 'AutoML Benchmark' framework from the publication Conrad2022AutoMLBench. It combines 4 AutoML tools and selects the most performant one. For this purpose, the AutoML tools are each run in a container to solve the problems of the different dependencies. This was simplified for this benchmark, so Docker is not needed. The best framework for the task was selected by hand, so only one AutoML tool is needed. Further information on the implementation can be found in the publication. More details on the used AutoML tool autosklearn can be found in Feurer2015Neur",
