Original code from https://github.com/gasteigerjo/dimenet. Settings are almost similar compared to original work for QM9. We had to reduce the batch size to 16 and the maximum number of edges or neighbours to 17 due to memory issues (in addition to 5A cutoff). For angles, multi-edges and correct images are taken into account. We added a standard scaler for regression. No additional features were introduced but geometry and atom type. Training was carried out on A100-SXM with 41 GB of memory.",
