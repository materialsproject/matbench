Original code from https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/megnet. Settings are similar compared to original work: A model depth of 3 and units for MegNet block of [64,32,32], a Set2Set encoder for node and edge embeddings, feed-forward blocks of units [64, 32], softplus activation and gauss distance expansion with cutoff of 5A and 25 bins with 0.4 sigma. We used a larger input embedding vector [64] of atom species and added the charge as input graph attributes. We trained with MAE loss and a linear learning rate scheduler from 5e-4 to 5e-6 over 1000 epochs using Adam. We added a standard scaler for regression. Training was carried out on A100-SXM with 41 GB of memory.",
