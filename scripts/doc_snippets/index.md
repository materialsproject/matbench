## Overview

[Matbench](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3) is an [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org) for **materials science**; a
**curated set of 13 supervised, pre-cleaned, ready-to-use ML tasks** for benchmarking and fair comparison. The tasks span a wide domain of
inorganic materials science applications including electronic, thermodynamic, mechanical, and thermal properties among crystals, 2D materials,
disordered metals, and more.  

**The [Matbench python package](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matbench) provides everything needed to use Matbench with your ML algorithm in ~10 lines of code or less.** The web pages and repository online contain full result files, citations, methodologies, and code for the algorithms shown.

## What can Matbench offer?

### This website


- **Leaderboard of results for state-of-the-art materials ML algorithms on standardized test problems**
- Interactively explore and download the tasks on [MPContribs-ML](https://ml.materialsproject.org/browse), a platform hosted by [The Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org). See [Benchmark Info](Benchmark%20Info/matbench_v0.1/) for links to each dataset.
- **Each and every result is backed by a peer-reviewed publication and/or a jupyter notebook** (similar to Papers With Code) - i.e., how were these results were obtained?
- Glossary of all algorithms' results on the Matbench problems


### The Matbench Python package

- Probe ML algorithms strengths and weaknesses across a wide range of materials property prediction tasks
- Run a full benchmark in ~10 lines of code
- Submit results as a PR to the [Matbench repo](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matbench) to compare with other algorithms and appear on the leaderboard
- Benchmark both **general purpose** ML models as well as algorithms specialized for particular domains


## Summary of Matbench's Tasks

Matbench's 13 tasks can be broken down into various categories; it includes both the small - less than 10,000 samples - datasets that characterize
experimental materials data as well as larger datasets from computer modelling methods like density functional theory (DFT).

Each task in Matbench consists of a three things:

1. **A set of inputs:** crystal structures or chemical compositions.
2. **A set of outputs:** target properties, such as formation energy.
3. **A test procedure:** a way to get a score for your algorithm


The Matbench Python package provides functions for getting the first two (packaged together for each task as a _dataset_) as well as running 
the test procedure. See the [How to use](How%20To%20Use/) documentation page to get started.
