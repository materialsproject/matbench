The tasks span a wide domain of inorganic materials science applications including electronic, thermodynamic, mechanical, and thermal properties among crystals, 2D materials, disordered metals, and more. The Matbench python package provides everything needed to use Matbench with your ML algorithm in ~10 lines of code or less. What can Matbench offer? This website Leaderboard of results for state-of-the-art materials ML algorithms on standardized test problems Interactively explore and download the tasks on MPContribs-ML , a platform hosted by The Materials Project . See Benchmark Info for links to each dataset. Each and every result is backed by a peer-reviewed publication and a jupyter notebook (similar to Papers With Code) - i.e., how were these results were obtained? Glossary of all algorithms' results on the Matbench problems The Matbench Python package Probe ML algorithms strengths and weaknesses across a wide range of materials property prediction tasks Run a full benchmark in ~10 lines of code Submit results as a PR to the Matbench repo to compare with other algorithms and appear on the leaderboard Benchmark both general purpose ML models as well as algorithms specialized for particular domains Summary of Matbench's Tasks Matbench's 13 tasks can be broken down into various categories; it includes both the small - less than 10,000 samples - datasets that characterize experimental materials data as well as larger datasets from computer modelling methods like density functional theory (DFT). Each task in Matbench consists of a three things: A set of inputs: crystal structures or chemical compositions. A set of outputs: target properties, such as formation energy. A test procedure: a way to get a score for your algorithm The Matbench Python package provides functions for getting the first two (packaged together for each task as a dataset ) as well as running the test procedure.

We make this distinction because some algorithms can be trained and used - in theory - for predicting any property of a material as long as they are trained on sufficient data. Others are specialized for particular domains and need a separate comparison for fair analysis. General purpose algorithms General purpose algorithms are valid for all the tasks in a benchmark using the same human-chosen configuration . Beyond defining a single configuration before beginning a benchmark, a human should not be hand-tuning or informing the algorithm about architecture, parameters, or hyperparameters. However, general purpose algorithms can automatically determine hyperparameters and parameters as part of their fitting processes in each fold. We include algorithms as \"general purpose\" to include on the general purpose leaderboard if any one of the following criteria is met for Matbench v0.1: - All 13 tasks are recorded, OR... - All 10 regression tasks are recorded, OR... - All 9 structure tasks are recorded. If only the 9 structure tasks are recorded, the algorithm is marked with \"requires structure\". General purpose algorithms' results will appear on both the General Purpose Leaderboard as well as the Task-specific leaderboards. Task specific algorithms Task-specific algorithms can fit on any subset of tasks; for example, a single task. Task-specific algorithms may be valid or specialized only for a subset of the tasks in the benchmark. For example, if you have a model which was specifically created for predicting bulk metallic glasses, you may submit a benchmark containing only results for the matbench_glass dataset. Task-specific results will only appear on the Task-specific leaderboards, not on the General Purpose Leaderboard . Why MAE? Mean absolute error was chosen as the ranking metric for regression because: The meaning of MAE is the most easily inferred Dataset targets which should be analyzed according to relative error (such as bulk moduli) have their target transformed to order-of-magnitude form (e.g., log10). MAE are valid for all target values, unlike mean absolute percentage errors, which are invalid for 0-valued targets. That being said, other error metrics are also informative beyond what MAE can offer. Therefore, Matbench offers multiple error metrics to help assess generalization error. Mean absolute percentage error ( mape* ) scores Mean absolute percentage error is only valid on sets of data without any true values of zero. Also, small true values can result in very large MAPE for samples with even very small predicted error. A threshold of 1e-5 is applied to mask samples with true absolute values smaller than this from the MAPE calculation. The reported MAPE is the decimal (not percentage) among these masked samples; i.e., a MAPE of 11% corresponds to mape*=0.11 , and a MAPE of 11,000% corresponds to mape*=110 . Please use the given MAPE scores with a grain of salt, as they are not complete for the reason given above .","title":"Notes on Benchmarking"},{"location":"Benchmark%20Info/notes/#notes-on-benchmarking","text":"","title":"Notes on Benchmarking"},{"location":"Benchmark%20Info/notes/#general-purpose-vs-task-specific-algorithms","text":"\"General purpose\" algorithms are treated differently from task-specific algorithms in Matbench for the purposes of ranking.

description: The Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-021-00650-1) introduces a new graph convolution layer that explicitly models both two and three body interactions in atomistic systems. This is achieved by composing two edge-gated graph convolution layers, the first applied to the atomistic line graph L(g) (representing triplet interactions) and the second applied to the atomistic bond graph g (representing pair interactions). The atomistic graph g consists of a node for each atom i (with atom/node representations hi), and one edge for each atom pair within a cutoff radius (with bond/pair representations eij). The atomistic line graph L(g) represents relationships between atom triplets: it has nodes corresponding to bonds (sharing representations eij with those in g) and edges corresponding to bond angles (with angle/triplet representations tijk).The line graph convolution updates the triplet representations and the pair representations; the direct graph convolution further updates the pair representations and the atom representations.

graph convolution layer that explicitly models both two and three body interactions in atomistic systems. This is achieved by composing two edge-gated graph convolution layers, the first applied to the atomistic line graph L(g) (representing triplet interactions) and the second applied to the atomistic bond graph g (representing pair interactions). The atomistic graph g consists of a node for each atom i (with atom/node representations hi), and one edge for each atom pair within a cutoff radius (with bond/pair representations eij). The atomistic line graph L(g) represents relationships between atom triplets: it has nodes corresponding to bonds (sharing representations eij with those in g) and edges corresponding to bond angles (with angle/triplet representations tijk).The line graph convolution updates the triplet representations and the pair representations; the direct graph convolution further updates the pair representations and the atom representations.","title":"Algorithm description:"},{"location":"Full%20Benchmark%20Data/matbench_v0.1_alignn/#notes","text":"None Raw data download and example notebook

description: Automatminer express v1.03.20200727. Based on automatic featurization, tree-based feature reduction, and genetic-algorithm based AutoML with the TPOT package. Notes: All data was generated using the same config (express, default). The automatminer version requirement specifies the versions of many dependent packages, such as matminer, which are required for the algorithm to work in your virtualenv.

implementation as in https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn. Utility modifications were made in order to run CGCNN without error across all structure tasks. Adapted from data originally taken from Dunn et. al 'Benchmarking materials property prediction methods: the Matbench test set and Automatminer reference algorithm' (2020). Training was performed using one NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU using CUDA (accompanied by two Intel Xeon E5-2623 CPUs with 60GB RAM). Each outer NCV training set was split 75/25 for train/validation; thus the final split for each fold was 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test. Each model is trained in epochs of 128-structure batches by optimizing according to mean squared error loss (regression) or binary cross-entropy (classification). After each epoch, the validation loss is computed with the same scoring functions as the final evaluation: MAE for regression or ROC-AUC for classification (made negative so that higher loss represents worse performance). To prevent overfitting, the training is stopped early when the validation loss does not improve over a period of at least 500 epochs.

https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn. Utility modifications were made in order to run CGCNN without error across all structure tasks. Adapted from data originally taken from Dunn et. al 'Benchmarking materials property prediction methods: the Matbench test set and Automatminer reference algorithm' (2020). Training was performed using one NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU using CUDA (accompanied by two Intel Xeon E5-2623 CPUs with 60GB RAM). Each outer NCV training set was split 75/25 for train/validation; thus the final split for each fold was 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test. Each model is trained in epochs of 128-structure batches by optimizing according to mean squared error loss (regression) or binary cross-entropy (classification). After each epoch, the validation loss is computed with the same scoring functions as the final evaluation: MAE for regression or ROC-AUC for classification (made negative so that higher loss represents worse performance). To prevent overfitting, the training is stopped early when the validation loss does not improve over a period of at least 500 epochs.","title":"Algorithm description:"},{"location":"Full%20Benchmark%20Data/matbench_v0.1_cgcnnv2019/#notes","text":"Raw data download and example notebook available on the matbench repo .","title":"Notes:"},{"location":"Full%20Benchmark%20Data/matbench_v0.1_cgcnnv2019/#references-in-bibtex-format","text":"['@article{Xie2018,\\n' ' doi = {10.1103/physrevlett.120.145301},\\n' ' url = {https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.120.145301},\\n' ' year = {2018},\\n' ' month = apr,\\n' ' publisher = {American Physical Society ({APS})},\\n' ' volume = {120},\\n' ' number = {14},\\n' ' author = {Tian Xie and Jeffrey C.

from the Sine Coulomb Matrix and MagPie featurization algorthims. Sine Coulomb Matrix creates structural features based on Coulombic interactions inside a periodic boundary condition (i.e., for crystalline materials with known structure). MagPie features are weighted elemental features based on elemental data such as electronegativity, melting point, and electron affinity. Algorithms were run inside of the Automatminer v1.0.3.20191111 framework for convenience, though no auto-featurization or AutoML were run. Data cleaning dropped features with more than 1% nan samples, imputing missing samples using the mean of the training data. No feature reduction was performed. Both featurization techniques were applied to structure problems, only MagPie features were applied to problems without structure. Random forest uses 500 estimators. Notes: No hyperparameter tuning was performed on the RF, as a large, constant number of trees were used in constructing each fold's model; the entire training+validation set was used as training data for the RF.

Sine Coulomb Matrix creates structural features based on Coulombic interactions inside a periodic boundary condition (i.e., for crystalline materials with known structure). MagPie features are weighted elemental features based on elemental data such as electronegativity, melting point, and electron affinity. Algorithms were run inside of the Automatminer v1.0.3.20191111 framework for convenience, though no auto-featurization or AutoML were run. Data cleaning dropped features with more than 1% nan samples, imputing missing samples using the mean of the training data. No feature reduction was performed. Both featurization techniques were applied to structure problems, only MagPie features were applied to problems without structure. Random forest uses 500 estimators.","title":"Algorithm description:"},{"location":"Full%20Benchmark%20Data/matbench_v0.1_rf/#notes","text":"No hyperparameter tuning was performed on the RF, as a large, constant number of trees were used in constructing each fold's model; the entire training+validation set was used as training data for the RF.

The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{ \\\\ thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given { \\\\ textasciitilde}104 or greater data points.

The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13{ \\\\ thinspace}ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given { \\\\ textasciitilde}104 or greater data points. We encourage evaluating materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.}, \\n issn={2057-3960}, \\n doi={10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3}, \\n url={https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-020-00406-3} \\n } \\n \" , '@article{Jain2013, \\n author = {Jain, Anubhav and Ong, Shyue Ping and Hautier, Geoffroy and Chen, Wei and Richards, William Davidson and Dacek, Stephen and Cholia, Shreyas and Gunter, Dan and Skinner, David and Ceder, Gerbrand and Persson, Kristin a.}, \\n doi = {10.1063/1.4812323}, \\n issn = {2166532X} , \\n journal = {APL Materials}, \\n number = {1} , \\n pages = {011002} , \\n title = {{The Materials Project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation}}, \\n url = {http://link.aip.org/link/AMPADS/v1/i1/p011002/s1 \\\\ &Agg=doi}, \\n volume = {1} , \\n year = {2013} \\n }' , '@article{Petousis2017, \\n author={Petousis, Ioannis and Mrdjenovich, David and Ballouz, Eric \\n and Liu, Miao and Winston, Donald and Chen, Wei and Graf, Tanja \\n and Schladt, Thomas D. and Persson, Kristin A. and Prinz, Fritz B.}, \\n title={High-throughput screening of inorganic compounds for the \\n discovery of novel dielectric and optical materials}, \\n journal={Scientific Data}, \\n year= {2017} , \\n month= {Jan} , \\n day= {31} , \\n publisher={The Author(s)}, \\n volume= {4} , \\n pages= {160134} , \\n note={Data Descriptor}, \\n url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.134} \\n }' ], 'columns' : { 'n' : 'Target variable.

MatbenchTask.get_test_data: Get test data for nested cross validation. MatbenchTask.record: Record your predicted results for the test data. MatbenchTask.validate: Check to make sure the data you recorded for this task is valid. You can iterate through the folds of a matbench task using .folds and the .get_*_data methods. You can load the results of a task without having to load large datasets themselves. However, to get training and testing data, you must load the datasets.

You can load the results of a task without having to load large datasets themselves. However, to get training and testing data, you must load the datasets. Tasks loaded from files do not automatically load the dataset into memory; to load a dataset into memory, use MatbenchTask.load(). See the full documentation online for more info and tutorials on using MatbenchTask.
